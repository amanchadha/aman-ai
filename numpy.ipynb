    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It is informally known as the the **swiss army knife** of the **data scientist**.\n",
    "- It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object `numpy.ndarray`, and tools for operating on these arrays. \n",
    "- If you're already familiar with numerical processing in a different language like MATLAB and R, here are some recommended references: \n",
    "    - [NumPy for MATLAB users](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html)\n",
    "    - [Python for R users](http://www.data-analysis-in-python.org/python_for_r.html)\n",
    "- **Related primers:** [Matplotlib](../matplotlib) and [SciPy](../scipy).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "- A NumPy array is a **grid of values**, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. \n",
    "- The number of dimensions is the **rank** of the array; the **shape** of an array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.\n",
    "- We can initialize NumPy arrays from **(nested) lists and tuples**, and access elements using square brackets as array subscripts:"

    "        - When either of the dimensions belonging to both arrays being compared is \\\\(1\\\\), the **other** is used. In other words, dimensions with size \\\\(1\\\\) are **stretched or “copied”** to match the other. This is the **primary broadcasting** step.\n",
